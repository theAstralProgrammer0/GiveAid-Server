### BACKEND PLAN FOR LAWSON AND NOBLET

### 1. Set Up Project Infrastructure

#### Initial Setup
One person (e.g., the team lead) should handle the initial setup:
- Create the Django project and initial app structure.
- Set up the virtual environment and install necessary dependencies (Django, Django REST Framework, etc.).
- Configure the initial settings (database, installed apps, middleware).
- Initialize the Git repository and push the initial setup to the remote repository.

#### Database Models
- Define the database models as a team. Ensure everyone understands the relationships between models.
- One person can handle creating the initial models in `giveaid/models.py` and running the initial migrations.

### 2. Share Features and Responsibilities

#### Feature Allocation
Features are based on their dependencies and functionality. 
Allocations:

**Person A:**
- User Registration and Authentication
- Payment Processing and Donation Creation

**Person B:**
- Viewing and Selecting Causes
- Viewing Success Stories and Volunteer Information

#### Initial Features for Person A (Dependency Setup)
Person A should start with:
1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Set up user models, serializers, and views for registration, login, logout, password reset, and email verification.
   - Integrate JWT or session-based authentication.
   - Define and document the API endpoints for user management.

2. **Payment Processing and Donation Creation:**
   - Implement the donation model and initial views for creating donations.
   - Set up integration with a payment gateway.
   - Ensure anonymous donations are handled (no user linkage).

Once Person A has established the user management system and initial donation creation process, Person B can start working on their features.

#### Features for Person B
With the authentication system and basic donation process in place, Person B can proceed with:
1. **Viewing and Selecting Causes:**
   - Implement the serializers, and views for listing and detailing causes.
   - Set up API endpoints for retrieving and filtering causes.

2. **Viewing Success Stories and Volunteer Information:**
   - Create serializers, and views for success stories and volunteer data.
   - Define and document the API endpoints for these features.

### 3. Detailed Task Breakdown

#### Person A: User Registration and Authentication
- **User Model Design:** Extend Django’s User model if needed. (DONE)
- **Serializers:** Create serializers for user data.
- **Views:** Implement views for registration, login, password reset, and verification.
- **URLs:** Define URLs for user-related actions.
- **JWT Integration:** Set up JWT for token-based authentication.

#### Person B: Viewing and Selecting Causes
- **Cause Model Design:** Define fields like name, description, and target amount. (DONE)
- **Serializers:** Create serializers for cause data.
- **Views:** Implement views for listing and detailing causes.
- **URLs:** Define URLs for cause-related actions.

### 4. Workflow and Communication

#### Daily Standups
- Conduct daily standup meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and plans for the day.

#### Clear Documentation
- Maintain clear and updated documentation of the API endpoints, models, and any shared logic.

#### Frequent Code Reviews
- Regularly review each other’s code to ensure consistency and quality.
- Use pull requests and require approvals before merging into the main branch.

### 5. Prioritize Features

**Initial Features:**
1. **User Management:** Essential for any further development that involves user data.
2. **Donation Creation:** Establish the basic functionality for creating donations.

**Subsequent Features:**
3. **Causes Management:** Needed for linking donations to specific causes.
4. **Success Stories and Volunteer Information:** Less critical but enhances user engagement.

### Summary

1. **Initial Setup:** Handled by one person to set the foundation.
2. **Feature Allocation:** Split based on dependencies and logical grouping.
3. **Daily Communication:** Regular standups and code reviews.
4. **Documentation:** Keep everything documented for clarity and future reference.
5. **Prioritize:** User management and donation creation first, followed by causes and other features.
